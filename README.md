# timonlukas.me-main
The main module for my website!

## Tools used
* NodeJS as a static file server
* Vue 2 as the Javascript frontend library
* Bulma as the CSS framework
* [timonlukas.me-git](https://github.com/TimonLukas/timonlukas.me-git) as deployment tool

## Lessons learned
* MathJax uses "signals" instead of "events"; it's complicated to use this with async stuff
* Vue is freaking awesome
* I love Bulma
